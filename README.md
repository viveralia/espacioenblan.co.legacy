Blanco is a minimal, modern WordPress theme, developed from scratch for espacioenblan.co, a digital product studio based in Mexico City. The theme had to keep the essence of the studio while being capable of scaling, mainly with content.
It is highly focused on conversions and lead capture by being connected to the Mailchimp API.

## Usability and User Experience
Being espacioenblan.co a digital product studio, this theme is also highly focused on User Experience best practices (Jakob Nielsen's usability heuristics).
